      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>The concept of my project is rooted in the idea of using artificial intelligence as a tool for generating creative works that reflect human emotions and experiences. By inviting users to input their current mood, the application creates a personalized artistic experience, first generating a poem that expresses the user’s emotional state and then composing a short musical piece that mirrors the tone and mood of that poem. This interaction between text and music is intended to provide users with a multi-sensory experience, where language and sound come together to evoke emotion and reflection. The use of generative AI models, such as OpenAI’s GPT for poetry and Hugging Face’s musicgen model for musical composition, showcases how technology can be harnessed not only for practical applications but also for artistic expression. The creative process becomes collaborative, with the user providing emotional input and the AI models translating that input into a tangible, artistic output. Looking ahead, I plan to enhance the immersive quality of the application by integrating text-to-speech capabilities, allowing the generated poem to be spoken aloud while the music plays in the background. This would elevate the emotional resonance of the experience by combining auditory elements in a more holistic way.
